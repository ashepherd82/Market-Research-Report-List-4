<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neurovascular Stent Retrievers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Expanding Stents</li><li>Self-Expanding Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neurovascular Stent Retrievers Market Types include Balloon Expanding Stents and Self-Expanding Stents. Balloon Expanding Stents are inserted into the blocked blood vessel and expanded by a balloon to restore blood flow. Self-Expanding Stents are made of a special mesh-like material that expands on its own once inserted, providing support to the blood vessel and maintaining its patency. Both types of stents are used in neurovascular procedures to remove blood clots and restore blood flow to the brain, reducing the risk of stroke.</p></p>
