<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brown Sugar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>

<p><p>Brown sugar is a popular sweetener that comes in two main types: light brown sugar and dark brown sugar. Light brown sugar has a milder flavor and lighter color due to a lower molasses content, making it ideal for baking and desserts where a subtle sweetness is desired. Dark brown sugar has a stronger, more intense flavor and darker color from a higher molasses content, which is great for recipes that call for a rich, caramel-like taste. Both types of brown sugar can be used interchangeably in most recipes, but may affect the overall taste and color of the final product.</p></p>
