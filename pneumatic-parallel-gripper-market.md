<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Parallel Gripper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting</li><li>Double Acting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pneumatic parallel grippers are commonly classified into two types: single acting and double acting. In single acting grippers, air pressure is used to open the gripper while a spring mechanism is responsible for closing it. On the other hand, double acting grippers use air pressure for both opening and closing the gripper. Single acting grippers are typically simpler and more cost-effective, while double acting grippers offer faster and more precise operation. Both types cater to different applications based on specific requirements.</p></p>
