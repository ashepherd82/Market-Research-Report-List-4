<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Partially Covered Biliary Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non Absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Metal Partially Covered Biliary Stents are used for the treatment of biliary strictures. Absorbable stents are designed to degrade over time, allowing the body's natural healing process to take over. Non-absorbable stents, on the other hand, are designed to remain in place indefinitely. Both types of stents have their own advantages and limitations, making them suitable for different patient cases. The choice between absorbable and non-absorbable stents depends on factors such as the patient's condition, treatment goals, and physician's recommendation.</p></p>
